# Cooking Range Heat Regulator

## Summary
I'm planning to create a project that can sense the temperature of my cooking range and adjusts the fire according to the food.
Whenever I cook rice, I always multitask other things such as homework, messaging, and preparing other food ingredients
And this will leave the rice unsupervised, and end up getting burnt and ugly. All in all, I will never have to buy those smart cooking devices. 


## Plan

Gather materials: I will need a temperature sensor (such as a thermocouple or thermistor), 
Raspberry Pi, a relay (to control the fire on the range), 
and any other necessary components (such as wires, breadboard, etc.).

Connect the temperature sensor: Connect the temperature sensor to 
the microcontroller according to the sensor's specifications. 
Either a voltage divider or amplifier to make the sensor output 
compatible with the Raspberry Pi. 

Developing the Python Code that is compatible with Raspberry Pi. 

Control the fire: Connect the relay to the cooking range's gas valve or electric burner control circuit. 
Test the system to ensure that the fire is turning on and off correctly based on the temperature sensor's readings.

Additional features: I can add additional features such as a display to show the current temperature, 
a user interface to set the desired temperature, or even connect the device to the internet to control it remotely.

Finalize the design and test it thoroughly to make sure it's safe and efficient.

For the Budget: I just wanna say that there are available electronics shops here in the Philippines and it is costly to buy from amazon
but I'm open to any plans on how I can execute this. So the budget that I have here might not optimal so I'm open to any advice on how I can lower the cost
