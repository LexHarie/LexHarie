# Cooking Range Heat Regulator

## Summary
I'm planning to create a project that can sense the temperature of my cooking range and adjusts the fire according to the food.
Whenever I cook rice, I always multitask other things such as homework, messaging, and preparing other food ingredients
And this will leave the rice unsupervised, and end up getting burnt and ugly. All in all, I will never have to buy those smart cooking devices. 


## Plan

Gather materials: I will need a temperature sensor (such as a thermocouple or thermistor), 
Raspberry Pi, a relay (to control the fire on the range), 
and any other necessary components (such as wires, breadboard, etc.).

Connect the temperature sensor: Connect the temperature sensor to 
the Raspberry Pi according to the sensor's specifications. 
Either a voltage divider or amplifier to make the sensor output 
compatible with the Raspberry Pi. 

Web interface and Python code: I will create a web interface that can be accessed from any device with a web browser. This allows me to input the desired 
temperature from any device that has internet access.

Control the fire: Connect the relay to the cooking range's gas valve or electric burner control circuit. 
Test the system to ensure that the fire is turning on and off correctly based on the temperature sensor's readings. Or instead of turning it off or on, I will use variable-frequency drive (VFD) or a pulse width modulation (PWM) controller that sets the airflow for combustion (which is cooler, but I need to ask for opinions from my electricity teacher)

Finalize the design and test it thoroughly to make sure it's safe and efficient.

Thoughts about the budget: We have electrical shops here in the Philippines, since I live in the city, and they are affordable compared to these I listed online. 
I would like to know more on what can we do to make this more affordable.
